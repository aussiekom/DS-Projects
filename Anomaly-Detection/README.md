### Anomaly Detection

**Anomalies are data points that significantly differ from the majority of other data points in a dataset.** They can manifest as rare events, errors, or unexpected observations. Detecting anomalies is challenging because they often hide within the noise and complexities of large datasets. Traditional statistical methods and clustering algorithms are not always suitable for handling these challenges effectively.
