### Isolation Forests

The isolation forest is an efficient machine learning algorithm designed specifically for anomaly detection. It was introduced by Fei Tony Liu, Kai Ming Ting, and Zhi-Hua Zhou in a research paper published in 2008. **The core idea behind the Isolation Forest is to isolate anomalies by recursively partitioning the dataset into subsets.** 

Here are the details:

1. The algorithm begins by randomly selecting a feature and then choosing a random value within the range of that feature. This creates a partition, effectively splitting the dataset into two smaller subsets.
2. The process of random partitioning is repeated recursively until each data point is isolated in its own subset or until a predefined stopping criterion is met.
3. Anomalies are identified as data points that require fewer partitioning steps to be isolated. In other words, anomalies are typically found in smaller, less dense partitions, making them stand out from the rest of the data.

Isolation forests are highly scalable and perform well on large datasets. They are also efficient and robust to the dimensions of the dataset.
