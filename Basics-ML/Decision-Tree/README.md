### Decision Tree

**What is decision tree?**
The Decision Tree algorithm falls under the category of supervised learning methods and unlike other supervised learning algorithms, the decision tree algorithm can be used for solving regression and classification problems too.

The primary objective when employing a Decision Tree is to construct a training model capable of predicting the class or value of the target variable. This is achieved by extracting straightforward decision rules from existing data (training data).

In the context of Decision Trees, the process of predicting a class label for a record initiates at the tree's root. The comparison begins by assessing the values of the root attribute against the corresponding attribute of the record. Depending on the outcome of this comparison, we navigate through the branches linked to that value and proceed to the next node in the tree.


**Description of the data:**
* Age: age of the patient (years)
* BMI: body mass index (kg/m2)
* Glucose: glucose concentration in blood (mg/dL)
* Insulin: insulin concentration in blood (microU/mL)
* HOMA: homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (glucose times insulin)
* Leptin: concentration of leptin - hormone of energy expenditure (ng/mL)
* Adiponectin: concentration of adiponectin - protein regulating glucose level (micro g/mL)
* Resistin: concentration of resistin - protein secreted by adipose tissue (ng/mL)
* MCP.1: concentration of MCP.1 - protein that recruits monocytes to the sites of inflammation due to tissue injure or inflammation (pg/dL)
* Classification: Healthy (1) or patient (2)
