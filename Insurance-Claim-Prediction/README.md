## About:
A challenging project, to anticipate whether the insurance will be claimed or not. The complexity arises due to the fact that the dataset has fewer samples, and is slightly imbalanced. Can we overcome these obstacles and build a good predictive model to classify them?


## Description of the data columns:
This data frame contains the following columns:

* **age:** age of policyholder
* **sex:** gender of policy holder (female=0, male=1)
* **bmi:** Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height, objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2)** using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 25
* **steps:** average walking steps per day of policyholder
* **children:** number of children / dependents of policyholder
* **smoker:** smoking state of policyholder (non-smoke = 0; smoker = 1)
* **region:** the residential area of policyholder in the US (northeast = 0, northwest = 1, southeast = 2, southwest = 3)
* **charges:** individual medical costs billed by health insurance
* **insurance claim:** yes = 1, no = 0

## Objective:
- Understand the Dataset & cleanup (if required).
- Build classification model to predict weather the insurance will be claimed or not.
- Also fine-tune the hyperparameters & compare the evaluation metrics of vaious classification algorithms.


## Plan of Actions:
Here are some of the necessary steps:

* Data Exploration
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Data Pre-processing
* Data Manipulation
* Feature Selection/Extraction
* Predictive Modelling
* Project Outcomes & Conclusion
